There are some things to keep in mind when reading this tutorial:
- **I am not an expert.** I will do my best to provide useful and correct information but ultimately I am only drawing from my experience and so will eventually be wrong.
As always it is good practice to draw from many sources of information rather than relying on just one.

- **There is no one way to do things.** The approaches I present here are just patterns I have landed on in my personal work and that I think are useful, but for any problem there are many solutions with different pros and cons, and I encourage you to explore them.
